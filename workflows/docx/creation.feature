Feature: Word document creation

  Rule: DOCX native paragraph authoring
    Native DOCX creation authors minimal packages and simple paragraphs without
    borrowed template bytes.

    @id-docx-create-minimal-package
    Scenario: DOCX create authors a minimal package with escaped bold italic text before section properties
      Given DOCX create source "new-document" is prepared
      When DOCX create paragraph "  <Frankenstein & friend>  " with bold and italic formatting is appended
      And DOCX create document is saved and reopened
      Then DOCX create package members equal "[Content_Types].xml,_rels/.rels,word/document.xml"
      And DOCX create paragraph 1 text equals "  <Frankenstein & friend>  "
      And DOCX create paragraph 1 run has bold and italic formatting
      And DOCX create paragraph 1 XML preserves boundary spaces and escapes special characters
      And DOCX create paragraph 1 is stored before the section properties

    @id-docx-create-style-validation
    Scenario: DOCX create appends a paragraph using a known paragraph style id
      Given DOCX create source "fixture-9548a1ce68caae9df12bc85732f1c19a098658c5dce3d79488814e4145299e5e" is prepared
      When DOCX create styled paragraph "Created heading" with style "Heading1" is appended
      And DOCX create document is saved and reopened
      Then DOCX create paragraph 5 text equals "Created heading"
      And DOCX create paragraph 5 uses paragraph style "Heading1"

    @id-docx-create-stale-opaque
    Scenario: DOCX create preserves opaque parts and invalidates earlier spans after append
      Given DOCX create source "fixture-9548a1ce68caae9df12bc85732f1c19a098658c5dce3d79488814e4145299e5e" is prepared
      And DOCX create paragraph 2 exact text "Genevese" span is remembered
      And DOCX create opaque part "docProps/core.xml" bytes are remembered
      When DOCX create plain paragraph "Appendix line" is appended
      And DOCX create current saved bytes are remembered
      And DOCX create stale replacement "Citizen" is attempted on the remembered span
      Then DOCX create refusal code equals "docx-stale-span"
      And DOCX create saved bytes equal the remembered bytes
      And DOCX create opaque part "docProps/core.xml" bytes are unchanged

    @id-docx-create-atomic-refusals
    Scenario Outline: DOCX create refuses <case> atomically
      Given DOCX create source "<source>" is prepared
      And DOCX create current saved bytes are remembered
      When DOCX create append refusal "<case>" is attempted
      Then DOCX create refusal code equals "<code>"
      And DOCX create saved bytes equal the remembered bytes

      Examples:
        | source                                                                       | case                      | code                   |
        | new-document                                                                 | text-number               | docx-invalid-argument  |
        | new-document                                                                 | options-string            | docx-invalid-argument  |
        | new-document                                                                 | bold-string               | docx-invalid-argument  |
        | new-document                                                                 | style-without-styles-part | docx-style-unsupported |
        | fixture-9548a1ce68caae9df12bc85732f1c19a098658c5dce3d79488814e4145299e5e | unknown-style             | docx-style-missing     |

  Rule: Document value API and selected save-reopen predicates
    The in-memory operations below check selected getters. Only scenarios that say
    save and reopen assert disk readback. Getter names and return conventions are
    API compatibility predicates, not general OOXML validity or rendering rules.

    @profile-document-value-api @id-docx-go-new-empty-body
    Scenario: A new document has a body and no paragraphs or tables
      Given a new Word document
      When its body paragraphs and tables are enumerated
      Then the body is present with zero paragraphs and zero tables
