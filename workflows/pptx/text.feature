Feature: Presentation anchored text editing

  Rule: PPTX relationship-ordered reads and anchored text replacement
    The first PPTX slice opens real packages, reads existing notes without creating
    missing notes parts, and performs exact anchored text replacement across runs.

    @id-pptx-readable-unsupported-topology
    Scenario: Read line breaks and field text faithfully but refuse editing that topology
      Given PPTX line-break and field text fixture is prepared from a real template
      When PPTX inspects the paragraph text and attempts an anchored edit on that topology
      Then PPTX exposes line breaks and field text faithfully and refuses the unsupported edit without mutation

    @id-pptx-cross-run-replace
    Scenario: Replace exact anchored text across runs and preserve unrelated members after reopen
      Given PPTX fragmented title fixture is prepared from a real template and an untouched ZIP member
      When PPTX replaces anchored cross-run text and saves then reopens the package
      Then PPTX preserves the replacement text, the starting run formatting, and unrelated ZIP member bytes

    @id-pptx-stale-anchor-refusal
    Scenario: Refuse a stale anchored replacement without mutation
      Given PPTX stale-anchor fixture is prepared from a real template
      When PPTX replaces anchored text once and retries with the stale anchor
      Then PPTX refuses the stale anchor and keeps the post-success bytes unchanged
