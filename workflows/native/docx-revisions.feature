  @id-docx-revisions-rollback
  Scenario: a later unsupported selected nested story rolls the whole resolution back
    Given the synthetic DOCX revisions fixture "rollback-unsupported" is opened
    And the current DOCX revision bytes are remembered
    Then the DOCX revision story texts for view "current" are
      | part              | text       |
      | word/document.xml | Body safe. |
    And the DOCX revision story texts for view "original" are

    When DOCX revisions are accepted for parts
      | part             |
      | word/document.xml |
      | word/footer2.xml  |

    And the DOCX revision refusal mentions "word/footer2.xml"
    And the DOCX revision refusal mentions "format"
    And the DOCX revision saved bytes equal the remembered bytes
    And the DOCX revision count is 2
    And the DOCX revision story texts for view "current" are
      | part              | text       |

      | word/document.xml |      |

  @id-docx-revisions-protected
  Scenario: protected documents refuse resolution without mutating bytes
    Given the synthetic DOCX revisions fixture "protected" is opened
