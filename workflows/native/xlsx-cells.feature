Feature: XLSX cell reads and style-preserving value edits
  Workbook cells are read from the preserved OOXML package and simple value edits
  patch only the required XML slots while keeping untouched package bytes intact.

  @id-xlsx-read-rel-linked-shared-strings
  Scenario: Read rel-linked shared strings, numbers, booleans and cached formulas across worksheets
    Given a synthetic two-sheet XLSX fixture with rel-linked shared strings, numbers, booleans and cached formulas
    When I open the workbook through the XLSX reader
    Then the workbook sheetnames follow workbook relationships
    And cell reads include shared strings, numbers, booleans and cached formulas across worksheets

  @id-xlsx-preserve-styled-cell-edit
  Scenario: Edit a styled existing cell without disturbing unrelated package parts
    Given the go-ooxml formatting workbook fixture
    When I change the styled cell A2 text to "Elizabeth Lavenza" and save and reopen the workbook
    Then the reopened cell keeps its style attributes and new value
    And unrelated ZIP parts still match the original bytes

  @id-xlsx-clear-cross-sheet-caches
  Scenario: Editing an input cell clears formula caches across worksheets and enables recalculation
    Given a synthetic two-sheet XLSX fixture with cross-sheet cached formulas
    When I change the input cell A1 to 10 and save the workbook
    Then every formula cache is removed across the worksheets
    And workbook calculation flags request full recalculation

  @id-xlsx-prefixed-namespace-safe-edits
  Scenario: Edit prefixed workbook and worksheet parts without creating unqualified spreadsheet nodes
    Given a synthetic prefixed XLSX fixture with blank cells and formulas
    When I write "Alpha" to prefixed A1, 7 to prefixed B1, and save the workbook
    Then the saved prefixed workbook keeps one qualified calcPr and qualified new cell values

  @id-xlsx-phonetic-guides-excluded
  Scenario: Read rich strings while excluding phonetic guides
    Given a synthetic XLSX fixture with phonetic guides in shared and inline rich strings
    When I open the workbook through the XLSX reader
    Then phonetic guides are excluded while rich text runs stay intact

  @id-xlsx-styled-blank-cell-editable
  Scenario: Read and edit a styled blank cell without losing its style
    Given a synthetic XLSX fixture with a styled blank cell
    When I change the blank styled cell A1 text to "filled" and save and reopen the workbook
    Then the blank styled cell was readable as null before editing
    And the reopened blank styled cell keeps its style and new value

  @id-xlsx-refuse-shared-formula-overwrite
  Scenario: Refuse destructive edits to an unsupported shared formula without mutating the workbook
    Given the shared-formula XLSX fixture
    When I try to overwrite the shared formula cell B2
    Then the shared formula edit is refused before mutation
    And saving afterwards keeps the workbook and worksheet parts byte-identical

  @id-xlsx-refuse-array-formula-overwrite
  Scenario: Refuse destructive edits to an unsupported array formula without mutating the workbook
    Given the shared-formula XLSX fixture
    When I try to overwrite the array formula cell D2
    Then the array formula edit is refused before mutation
    And saving afterwards keeps the workbook and worksheet parts byte-identical
